<h1>About Google</h1>
<p> Google is best known for its search engine, although
Google now offers a number of other services. </p>
<p> Google's mission is to organize the world's
information and make it universally accessible and
useful. </p>
<p> Its founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin started
Google at Stanford University. </p>

<p> This paragraph shows how multiple spaces between words are
treated as a single space. This is known as white space collapsing, and
the big spaces between some of the words will not appear in the
browser.

It also demonstrates how the browser will treat multiple carriage returns
(new lines) as a single space, too. </p>

 <h1>Basic Text Formatting</h1>
<p> This section is going to address the way in which you mark up text.
Almost every document you create will contain some form of text, so this
will be a very important section. </p>
<h2>Whitespace and Flow</h2>
<p> Before you start to mark up your text, it is best to understand what
XHTML does when it comes across spaces and how browsers treat long sentences
and paragraphs of text. </p>
<h2> Creating Headings Using hn Elements </h2>
<p> No matter what sort of document you are creating, most documents have
headings in some form or other... </p>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5> Heading 5 </h5>
<h6> Heading 6 </h6>


<!-- depreceated -->
<h3 align=”left” >Left-Aligned Heading</h3>
<p> This heading uses the align attribute with a value of left. </p>
<h3 align=”center” >Centered Heading</h3>
<p> This heading uses the align attribute with a value of center. </p>
<h3 align=”right” >Right-Aligned Heading</h3>
<p> This heading uses the align attribute with a value of right. </p>

<p> When you want to start a new line you can use the line break element.
So, the next <br/> word will appear on a new line. </p>
